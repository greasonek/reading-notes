1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
Communication
Empathy
Sensitivity


2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
At my current professional setting, psychological safety comes into play quite a bit. It is a small environment with a small team, some members are close outside of work, some members only interact in the workplace. Because the productivity of our work depends on how well we collaborate as a team, it is important that we all are able to contribute freely without fear of judgement or being shut down. This has been a problem in the past because we have had a mixture of members who are unempathetic and insensitive to the rest of the team, some members don't have a safe space in the office to talk freely about their personal lives because of the scrutiny of others. This is where psychological safety comes into play, without those members who unable to foster an environment open to communication, empathy and sensitivity, production and collaboration has gone up, more higher quality work is able to be done.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
Teams who are able to communicate and be open with one-another are able to operate more effectively. When teams operate more effectively, new ideas can flow. Without fear of judgement, being trampled on, or rejection of one's ideas, more team members are able to contribute ideas, come up with new solution and better ways of streamlining products or raising productivity. Team morale is boosted and in turn, company profits are able to go up.
