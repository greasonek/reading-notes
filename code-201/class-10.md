# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Syntax errors are errors such as incorrect spelling, where the logic is what was intended but perhaps the code is missing a ; or a function is spelled incorrectly when it's being called. A logic error is where the code runs and works, but the output is not what was intended, these are often harder to find.

2. In labs I've made spelling errors that were pretty easy to identify and correct. I've also made logical errors that were much more difficult to fix, such as calling a function twice in a code as with the salmon cookies lab where we create a form to add a new store in the chart and the cookies per hour were being rendered twice.

3. I imagine there will be a lot of instances where I'll need to search for code errors and fix both syntax and logical errors while coding professionally. Learning to identify and fix logical errors will come in handy as I move forward with this career path.

## JavaScript Debugger

1. The JavaScript Debugger tool allows one to see how a webpage is structured, how it's styled and what sort of functions are running in the application. These three sections can be changed and manipulated within the debugger tool so as to see what changes are being made to help identify where problems are occuring.

2. A breakpoint is a marker you set within the code on the JavaScript debugger tool that allows you to pause execution on that code.

3. A callstack is a section of the debugger that shows what code has been executed to get to the point in the code where a breakpoint is set and the code is paused.
