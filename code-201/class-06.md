# Class 6 Reading Notes

## JavaScript Object Basics

- Object = collection of related data/functionality; creating an object begins with defining and initializing a variable 
  - value of an item can be anything including numbers, arrays, functions, etc. 
  - items of an object (like numbers or arrays) are called **properties** and fucntions of objects are called **methods** 
  - functions within objects syntax is something like bio() instead of bio function() <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics">Source</a>
- *Object literal* - object who's content is literally written out as it's being created
- *"this"* refers to the current object the code is being written inside; useful when you have mulitple object literals and need to use the same method definition for every object you create.

1. An object is a piece of data that can contain multiple pieces of information and display that information back to the user. For example, an object can be a person. This object can contain properties like that person's name and age, and also contain a function (or method) that will display a bio for them back to the user (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics">Source</a>)
2. Object literals are great for transfering structured data items and allows send data more efficiently within one object rather than serveral. 
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
4. Bracket notation would be preferred if one would need to map a string to a value, however dot notation is generally preferred because it's easier to read. 
5. The term "this" refers to the object "dog"; The advantage of using "this" is when there are multiple object literals that need the same method definition. 

## Introduction to the DOM

1. DOM is the Document Object Model, a programming interface for web documents that represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">Source</a>). It is a Web API used to build websites. 

2. Without the DOM, JavaScipt language wouldn't have any model of web pages, HTML documents, SVG docs and their parts.
