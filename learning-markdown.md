# Learning Markdown
## Markdown is similar to HTML but much more simple. It offers an introduction to coding that is simple to understand and remember.
- Create headings usings #'s - for example one # is the main heading, two #'s is the first subheading; adding more #'s will make the font size of the heading smaller
- Space placement is important!
- To create paragraphs with Markdown, use no hashtags and no marker, just write your text. Include black space lines between paragraph lines to signify separation of line segments. Do not use indentions
- Asterisks are used to create emphasis on a word - for example, one asterisk *italicizes* a word, two asterisks makes a word **bold**
- To use a quote (or block quote), add a ">" in front of a paragraph 
- Unordered lists can be made using "-", "*" or "+"
- Add a link by using **[** name of link **]** (URL) (with no space inbetween the name of the link and the URL
