# Emily Greason 

Hi all! My name is Emily, I am an Operations Manager for a tier 2 cannabis cultivation facility in WA. I am switching careers to work in the tech industry because I am seeking more job security, work from home options and a higher income. I also create illustrations and do print making as a hobby when I'm not reading fantasy fiction novels or traveling with my fiance and our dogs.

# Growth Mindset

> "The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility"

## Growth Mindset is all about becoming better at any area of your life that you wish to pursue with the help of these three main ingredients:

- **Persistence** - When I'm faced with two options: to maintain the path I'm on and never reach my goals, or I can put in the work even though I know it will be challenging. How can I push past what I think is stopping me from achieving my goals?

- **Adaptability** - I find myself at a roadblock in my journey, how can I change my actions to push past my obstacles and stay on the course to success?

- **Inspiration** - I have an end goal in sight, nothing can stop me. I can view the success of my peers as a source of inspiration to remind myself that I can do anything.
