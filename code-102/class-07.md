## Control Flow 

> Look at the structure of the flow of a script to determine how it will execute, from start to finish but also what other functions exist within the flow

- control flow: order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- code runs in order from first to last line in file (unless conditionals or loops, etc)
    - conditional structure = if...else

## Expressions

- code that resolves to a value (some have side effects, some just evaluate)

    - ex) x = 7 --> expression uses = operator to assign value of x to 7; expression evaluates to 7
    - ex) 3 + 4 --> expression uses operator + to add 3 and 4 for value of 7

## Operators

- precedence determines order they're applied 
    - ex) * takes precedence over +, so 1 + 2 * 3 --> 2*3 takes precedence in the order before 1 + 2 --> parentheses overides precedence 

- binary and unary operators
    - binary requires two operands ( operand1 operator operand2)
    -undary requires one operand (on either side of operator)(operand operator)

- Assignment operators --> = (ex. x = f(); value of f() is **assigned** to x)

- Destructuring assignments 
-Evaluation/Nesting - chaining assignments can make result assign to another variable; **grouped right to left if no parenthesese but are evaluated left to right**

-Comparison operators - compares operand and returns value based on whether compairson is true ( ==,!=, !==, ===, <, <=, >, >=)

- Arithmetic operators - takes numerical values and returns a single numerical value; division by 0 = infinity



## Things I want to know more about

- Using JS to create pop ups for user email, phone number or info entry
