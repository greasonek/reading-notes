# Class 8 Reading Notes

# Expressions and Operators

> Expressions is unit of code that resolves and issue - some have side effects (ie assiging value) some purely evaluate

- ex) x=7 is expression that assigns value
- ex) x = (3+4) evaluates and produces value of 7


## Comparison Operators

- compares operands and returns logical value based on if comparison is true 
    - operand can be numerical, sting, logical, or object value - if operands are not same type JS tries to convert them to same type so can compare
    - == and !== operators are equality and inequality comparisons - do not try to convert operand to same type for comparison
    - == (equal)
    - != (not equal)
    - !== strict not equal
    - (>) greater than
    - (>=) greater than/euqal to --> *not to be confused with =>* 
    - < less than
    - <= less than/equal to



## Assignment Operators

- assigns value to left operand based on right operand 
- assignment operator is (=) which assigns value of right operand to left
    - ex) x+= f() means x = x + f()
    - ex) x-= f() means x = x - f()

# Loops

## For Statements

- repeats until specified condition evaluates to false
    - ex) for ([initialExpression]); [conditionExpression]; [incrimentExpression])
        statement 
    - to express multiple statements, use block statement ({}) to group statements

## While Statments
- executes statement as long as specified condition evaluates to true
    - ex) while (condition)
            statement
- condition in the loop should eventually become false
