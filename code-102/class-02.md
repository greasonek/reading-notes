## Text editor cheat sheet

- A text editor is a software that you can download and install on your computer or search in the web browser that allows you to write and manage text to build a website

Features should include:
1. code completion - allows you to start typing and it will offer some options for completion, includes closing of tags or brackets or quotation marks
2. syntax highlighting - colorizes the text
3. variety of themes - allows you to change the color of your background and colors in text; usually use dark background with bright text
4. selection of extensions to use - 

Emmett - shorthand language to make code writing faster

MAC includes "Text Edit"
- Using external text editor - should not see options for making text bold, italic, or underlined
- Create a folder on your desktop to store your entire website
- When saving files, should have appropriate extensions at the end of file names (i.e. index.**html** for HTML file or style.**css** for CSS file)

Third Party Options
-Notepad++ - for windows only 
-Text Wrangler - for MAC only, retired 2017
-BB Edit - must purchase after 30 day trial unless want to use just the features that Text Wrangler had
-VS Code - has Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS already built in, has all necessary features
-Atom - by GitHub, has all the features you need
-Brackets - only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript but can add more through extensions; has "Live Preview"
-Sublime Text - has all the features

> Difference between Text Editor and IDE
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) = suite of different software coming together; text editor + file manager + compiler + debugger in one software package
- Similar to Microsoft Outlook in that you can do many things in one package
