## NOSQL vs SQL

1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

- SQL databases

2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL databases

3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable meaning you can increase the load on a single server, whereas NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable meaning more servers can be added to handle high traffic volume

## SQL Modeling Techniques

1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

- One-to-many relationship is when an entry in a table can relate to more than one entry in another table, these are matched using foreign keys.

2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.

3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.

- Primary keys uniquely identify rows in a table while foreign keys are a set of columsn which match a primary key in another table.
