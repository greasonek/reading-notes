# GROWTH MINDSET

> Areas of strength are social and self awareness as well as self-management. I am able to identify emotional reactions as I am experiencing them, assess and react appropriately. I am also able to read social queues and react with empathy. My area of weakness is relational management. I do struggle with admitting fault but am aware and actively working to improve this.
