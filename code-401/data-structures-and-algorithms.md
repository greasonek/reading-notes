# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- Decide what the operation we're going to perform is and deciding how often we will execute that operation.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- Use promises to allow the call stack to be cleared between recursive calls.
