# Class 14 Reading Notes

## Project Ideas

1. Multi-player tic-tac-toe: 2 players can join and play against eachother. Gameboard updates in real time as players make their move.

2. Location sharing app: users can share their location with each other on a map (can use Google Maps API (though I know from experience this is very difficult)). Location updates are sent and received using sockets.
