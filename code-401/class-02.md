## Class 02 Reading Notes

## Intro to Node.js & Express

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

- Middlware is the middleman between the requests sent to the server and the responses set back.

2. Express the most popular _NODE_ _WEB_ _FRAMEWORK_.

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

- It is a more flexible way of compiling components to reach a goal. With Express you can insert any compatible middleware for the request handling chain.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

- A module is a library file for JavaScript that can be imported into other code using the require() function. Once the module is imported, we can access the properties and functions of objects within the module.

## NPM

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- v20.3.0

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

- npm i jshint

## TDD

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

- Tests allow for a simple enough code to get done what needs to get done so that there is less unnecessary code and work put into a project, leading to dryer code that can be more easily adjusted down the line if need be.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing

- Decrease the amount of defects on a program by increasing initial development effort

- Decressed effort in final phases of a project due to most of the work being done at the beginning

- Improved design quality in the code therefore a higher degree of technical quality

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

- Individual Pitfalls: writing too many tests at once, writing overly trivial tests

- Team Pitfalls: not everyone on the team adopting the same TDD measures, poor maintenance of the test suite leading to a test suite with a long running time

## Learning Goals

- I'd like to be able to write an API server with middleware and confidentally define all Express terminology and functionality
