# Class 42 Reading Notes

## Ethics

### Ethics in the workplace

- I read 'The code I'm still ashamed of' and 'Amazon workers demand Jeff Bezos cancel 'Recognition' software'. In the first article, it is clear how basic decisions like what medicine should I take are influenced by what we read on the web. It's important to look at the job you're doing and decide how that effects people who will be influenced as well as how the job you're doing aligns with your personal values and what choices you're going to make. The second article touches on how technology is influencing politics and that goes deeper into human rights, racial equality, and systems of oppression. It is not unimaginable that technology would be utilized in law enforment, however it is up to the individual to decide how their morals align with the company they work for and the work they're asked to do. It is also important to stand against inappropriate use of technology that enables threats to civil rights and to challenge companies, even those your work for, to assess what role they're playing.

### Ethics in Technology

- I read 'Self Driving Car Ethics' and ' Ethical dilemma of self driving cars', both talk about the way self-driving cars will react in situations where a choice needs to be made in case of an accident, how does the car protect? This can lead to issues involving ageism, sexism, racism, etc. How will the technology be built to consider these variables? Who's line of ethics are we going with and how will that affect the greater good of the population as a whole as more self-driving cars are introduced into society? When a human gets into a car accident, their natural instinct is self-preservation, cars don't have the same instinct so how do we program the technology to cause the least amount of harm?
