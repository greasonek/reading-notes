# Class 6 Reading Notes

## REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

- A smart guy who assisted in building the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. He also conducted research on why the internet works the way it works and helped to write the protocol for HTTP (the foundation of the web)

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- Because we need a URL to talk to all machines in the world.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- HTTP is like GPS for the web. It holds the location for all knowledge and information that is accessible on the internet.

4. What does a GET do?

- GET is like a verb for the internet.  When you type in a web address, the HTTP goes and GETS that URL and displays the webpage on your screen. The HTTP goes and GETS the URL for an image that is being displayed on a webpage. A browser's main function is to GET things to be displayed to the user.

5. What does a POST do?

- POST **adds** something from one system to another.

6. What does PUT do?

- PUT **replaces** something in another system.

7. What does PATCH do?

- PATCH does a **partial update** in a system.
